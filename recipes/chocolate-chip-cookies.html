    <h2>This dish includes:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li> 
        <li><strong>Vanilla Sauce</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you will need:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomatoe sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package of lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong>: While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong>: While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>
