    <h2>This dish includes:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs</strong>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta</strong>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you will need:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomatoe sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package of lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesean cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong>: While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong>: While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>
